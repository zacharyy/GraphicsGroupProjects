# Example OpenGL Graphics Programs
## This is for use at the University of Nevada, Reno CS 480/680 Graphics Class
Any students in that class follow the instructions at [**Github Setup**](https://github.com/HPC-Vis/computer-graphics/wiki/Github-Setup) to begin. This is part of the first assignment in the class and necessary for turning in assignments throughout the semester.

Read through the Wiki on this repository to understand how each class works. This Wiki focuses on the code in PA1.

# Projects

## PA0: Triangle
This is a simple colored triangle on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA0``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA1: Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates and revolves on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA1``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA2: Interaction: Menus, Keyboard, and Mouse
This is a cube that rotates and revolves on the screen based on user input. To run this project ```cd PA2``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA3: Moons
This is a cube that rotates and revolves on the screen with another smaller cube orbiting it. The cubes' rotation and revolution can be changed with user input. To run this project ```cd PA3``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA4: Blender and Model Loading
This is a model loader for obj files. To run this project ```cd PA4``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA5: Assimp and Model Loading
This is a model loader that loads model files using Assimp.  To run this project ```cd PA5``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA6: Assimp Texture Loading
The model loader from PA5 is now updated to load textures onto models.  To run this project ```cd PA6``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA7: Solar System
This is a simulation of the Solar System made by using the knowlege gained from previous projects.  To run this project ```cd PA7``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA8: Bullet
This is a simulation of a board, cylinder, cube, and sphere in which the cube can be moved with user input and can push the sphere which will bounce off the cylinder and the walls of the board.  To run this project ```cd PA8``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA9: Bullet
This is the simulation from PA8, now with lighting.  To run this project ```cd PA9``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.
